Open source software for CAN ( Controller area network ) tracing.
Current release is ScanFish 0.1.

Static version of binary ScanFish  should be found in BIN directory. It should work on all Linux systems (tested on Fedora 15). Source code is in SOURCE. Qt version of the ScanFish is developed in NetBeans IDE, so SOURCE is
actually a Netbeans project.

The work is going on.
